                <h4 id="list-item-1">Python Tutorial</h4>
                <p>Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. Our Python tutorial is designed for
                    beginners and professionals.

                    Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.

                    Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as the founder of Python
                    programming.

                    Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as installation, control
                    statements, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Modules, Exceptions, Date and Time, File I/O,
                    Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview questions to help you better understand Python
                    Programming.
                    <br>
                    What is Python ?<br>
                    Python is a general-purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports
                    Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and
                    provides lots of high-level data structures.

                    Python is an easy-to-learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive
                    for Application Development.

                    With its interpreted nature, Python's syntax and dynamic typing make it an ideal language for
                    scripting and rapid application development.

                    Python supports multiple programming patterns, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional
                    or procedural programming styles.

                    Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. It is a multipurpose
                    programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.

                    We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed, so we can write
                    a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.

                <h4 id="list-item-2">Python Features</h4>
                <p>Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from the other programming
                    languages. It supports object-oriented programming, procedural programming approaches and provides
                    dynamic memory allocation. We have listed below a few essential features.
                    <br>
                    1) Easy to Learn and Use
                    Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward
                    and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the
                    indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.
                    <br>
                    2) Expressive Language
                    Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world
                    program you simply type print("Hello World"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C
                    takes multiple lines.
                    <br>
                    3) Interpreted Language
                    Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The
                    advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.
                    <br>
                    4) Cross-platform Language
                    Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So,
                    we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for
                    several competing platforms by writing a program only once.
                    <br>
                    5) Free and Open Source
                    Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website
                    www.python.org. It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards make
                    new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source
                    means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny."
                    <br>
                    6) Object-Oriented Language
                    Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It
                    supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to
                    programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.
                    <br>
                    7) Extensible
                    It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be
                    used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use
                    that byte code.
                    <br>
                    8) Large Standard Library
                    It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web
                    developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor
                    flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for
                    Python web development.
                    <br>
                    9) GUI Programming Support
                    Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, Kivy are
                    the libraries which are used for developing the web application.
                    <br>

                    10) Integrated
                    It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line
                    like C,C++ Java. It makes easy to debug the code.
                    <br>
                    11. Embeddable
                    The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python
                    source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.
                    <br>
                    12. Dynamic Memory Allocation
                    In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the
                    variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned
                    integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.
                </p>
                <h4 id="list-item-3">Item 3</h4>
                <p>Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
                    The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
                    In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
                    In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
                    Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.
                    On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.
                    ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.
                    The following programming languages influence Python:
                    ABC language.
                    Modula-3
                    Why the Name Python?
                    There is a fact behind choosing the name Python. Guido van Rossum was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". It was late on-air 1970s.
                    
                    Van Rossum wanted to select a name which unique, sort, and little-bit mysterious. So he decided to select naming Python after the "Monty Python's Flying Circus" for their newly created programming language.
                    
                    The comedy series was creative and well random. It talks about everything. Thus it is slow and unpredictable, which made it very interesting.
                    
                    Python is also versatile and widely used in every technical field, such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Mobile Application, Desktop Application, Scientific Calculation, etc.

                <h4 id="list-item-4">Item 4</h4>
                <p>In this Section, we will discuss the basic syntax of Python, we will run a simple program to print Hello World on the console.

                    Python provides us the two ways to run a program:
                    
                    Using Interactive interpreter prompt
                    Using a script file
                    Let's discuss each one of them in detail.
                    
                    Interactive interpreter prompt
                    Python provides us the feature to execute the Python statement one by one at the interactive prompt. It is preferable in the case where we are concerned about the output of each line of our Python program.
                    
                    To open the interactive mode, open the terminal (or command prompt) and type python (python3 in case if you have Python2 and Python3 both installed on your system).
                    
                    It will open the following prompt where we can execute the Python statement and check their impact on the console.
                    
                    First Python Program
                    After writing the print statement, press the Enter key.
                    
                    First Python Program
                    Here, we get the message "Hello World !" printed on the console.
                    
                    Using a script file (Script Mode Programming)
                    The interpreter prompt is best to run the single-line statements of the code. However, we cannot write the code every-time on the terminal. It is not suitable to write multiple lines of code.
                    
                    Using the script mode, we can write multiple lines code into a file which can be executed later. For this purpose, we need to open an editor like notepad, create a file named and save it with .py extension, which stands for "Python". Now, we will implement the above example using the script mode.
                    
                    print ("hello world"); #here, we have used print() function to print the message on th</p>
